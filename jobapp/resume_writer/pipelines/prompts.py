# Job description analysis prompt
EditorPrompt1 = """
You are an expert resume writer. Your primary goal is to help me optimize my resume for a particular job description which I will provide you. Analyze it and identify what key skills, technologies, and short phrases the job description requires. Your response must be a YAML-formatted list of keywords and key phrases, under the field KEYWORDS.

**MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Your entire response must be a single YAML code block, and nothing else. Do not add any commentary, explanations, or markdown outside the code block.

Each item in the list should be a single skill, technology, or short phrase (2-5 words max) that is a core requirement or strong preference in the job description. Do not include full sentences, soft skills, or generic statements unless they are explicitly required in the job description. Do not repeat keywords. Follow the job description's convention for capitalization, for all keywords unless they are proper nouns.

**JOB DESCRIPTION**
{job_description}

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
```yaml
KEYWORDS:
  - 'python'
  - 'machine learning'
  - 'AWS'
  - 'data visualization'
  - 'statistical modeling'
  - 'team collaboration'
```

**DO NOT:**
- Do NOT include any text outside the YAML code block.
- Do NOT include explanations, summaries, or markdown headings.
- Do NOT include full sentences as keywords.
- Do NOT repeat keywords.
- Do NOT include generic statements unless explicitly required.

**IMPORTANT: Provide only the analysis. Do not ask questions, suggest next steps, or offer additional services. Focus solely on identifying the key skills.**"""

# Skill analysis list.
EditorPrompt2 = """Now go line by line through which skills I **definitely** have evidence of, **partially** have evidence of, or **definitely do not** have experience with. Use this to identify key words, skills, and phrases to ensure are added to my resume.

**CRITICAL PRIORITIZATION RULE:**
ONLY include skills that meet BOTH criteria:
1. **Job Relevance**: Skill appears as a keyword in the job description OR is directly related to a job requirement
2. **Evidence Strength**: I have clear evidence of using this skill

**DO NOT include skills that:**
- Don't appear in the job description (even if I have some experience)
- Are tangentially related but not core to the role
- I only have minimal/interview-level experience with

**MY RESEARCH EXPERIENCES:**
{experiences}

**ENHANCED EVIDENCE CLASSIFICATION RULES:**
For each skill FROM THE JOB DESCRIPTION, provide:
1. **Evidence Classification**: definitely/partially/not evidenced
2. **Evidence Quote**: Direct quote from research experiences supporting the claim
3. **Confidence Score**: 1-10 based on evidence strength
4. **Job Relevance Score**: 1-10 based on how central this skill is to the job description
5. **Combined Priority**: (Confidence × Job Relevance) / 10 = Priority Score (1-10)
6. **Incorporation Method**: Specify HOW to incorporate this skill:
   - "skills_list" - Add to skills list (1-3 words only: 'Python', 'SQL', 'Ridge Regression')
   - "profile_description" - Add to profile description (longer phrases/sentences)
   - "rephrase_bullet" - Modify existing bullet point (specify which one)
   - "new_bullet" - Create new bullet point
   - "substitute_term" - Replace similar term with job keyword

**MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT:**
For each job requirement, provide:
```
SKILL: [exact job description keyword]
JOB_RELEVANCE: [1-10 score]
EVIDENCE: [definitely/partially/none]
QUOTE: "[exact quote from research experiences]"
CONFIDENCE: [1-10]
PRIORITY: [Combined priority score 1-10]
METHOD: [skills_list/profile_description/rephrase_bullet/new_bullet/substitute_term]
TARGET: [if rephrase_bullet, specify which bullet to modify]
IMPLEMENTATION: "[exact suggested wording]"
```

**INCLUSION THRESHOLDS:**
- **Skills List**: Priority ≥6 AND Confidence ≥5
- **Bullet Points**: Priority ≥7 AND Confidence ≥7
- **Profile Description**: Priority ≥6 AND Confidence ≥8
- **Skip entirely**: Priority <6 OR skills not mentioned in job description

**NATURAL LANGUAGE BALANCE & EDITING PRIORITIES:**
Your primary goal is to optimize the `profile` and `skills` sections. Edits to existing `experience` bullet points should be rare and only made if the keyword substitution is extremely natural and preserves or enhances specificity.

- **Profile and Skills First**: The highest priority is to add relevant keywords to the `profile` description and the `skills` list.
- **Conservative Bullet Point Edits**: Only suggest `rephrase_bullet` or `substitute_term` if the keyword from the job description is a perfect, natural fit.
- **Preserve Specificity**: Do not replace a specific, technical term with a more generic one from the job description. For example, do not replace 'CNN' with 'AI models' if 'CNN' is the accurate term for the experience. The original specific term is more valuable.
- **Profile Description Scope**: This is the best place to incorporate broader keywords and concepts from the job description.
- **Skills List Scope**: This is the best place to add technical skills and tools listed in the job description that I have experience with.
- **Focus on Quality over Quantity**: Better to have fewer keywords that sound natural than many keywords that create awkward, robotic language.
- **Human-First Writing**: The resume should sound like it was written by a human, not an AI trying to game ATS systems.

**IMPORTANT: Only analyze skills that appear in the job description. Do not add skills that aren't job-relevant, even if I have strong evidence. Focus solely on job-specific keyword optimization with natural language flow.**"""

# Profile description planning step.
EditorPrompt3 = """Now you will create a detailed execution plan for the profile section optimization using the "Skill Mapping & Prioritization" from the previous response. Your goal is to create a compelling profile that highlights the most relevant skills and experiences for this job.

**Strict Profile Generation Rules:**

1.  **Opening Line**: Begin with "Physics PhD..." followed by a broader description of your professional role and key expertise, integrating highly relevant keywords from the job description naturally. Prioritize keywords with high "Job Relevance" and your "Confidence" from the previous analysis. For example: "Physics PhD with X+ years of experience in..."
2.  **Snapshot of Skills/Accomplishments/Knowledge**: Following the opening line, add 1-2 phrases that highlight your most relevant skills, accomplishments, and knowledge. These should come directly from the high-priority "profile_description" or "skills_list" recommendations, rephrased naturally into a flowing narrative.
3.  **Keyword Integration**: Seamlessly integrate keywords identified for "profile_description" and high-priority "skills_list" (Priority ≥6 AND Confidence ≥8) in a way that enhances the natural language flow, rather than appearing as a list.
4.  **Conciseness**: Adhere strictly to the 2-3 phrase/sentence limit and a maximum word count of 60 words. Every word must be impactful and relevant.
5.  **Human-Centric Language & Broad Appeal**: Ensure the profile sounds natural, compelling, and avoids robotic keyword stuffing. Focus on broad appeal and readability for a human reader, maintaining a professional and engaging tone.
6.  **No Bullet Points**: The profile must be a continuous paragraph, without any bullet points.
7.  **No Redundancy**: Avoid repeating information that will be clearly evident in later sections. For example, ensure no company names or specific job titles are present. VIOLATION OF THIS RULE will result in a resume that appears redundant and poorly structured to a hiring manager, as this information belongs in the Experience section.


**Current Profile Draft:**
```
{profile_draft}
```

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
First, provide the implementation plan in a YAML code block:

```yaml
PROFILE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN:
  CURRENT_ANALYSIS:
    STRENGTHS:
      - [List current profile strengths]
    WEAKNESSES:
      - [List areas needing improvement]
    
  IMPLEMENTATION:
    STEP_1:
      WHAT: [What to change]
      WHY: [Justification]
      HOW: [Specific changes to make]
      CHANGE: true
    STEP_2:
      WHAT: [What to change]
      WHY: [Justification]
      HOW: [Specific changes to make]

    PROPOSED: [New optimized profile text]
    CHANGE: true
    
  FORMATTING:
    LATEX_ESCAPES:
      - [List any terms needing LaTeX escaping]
    INDENTATION:
      - [Note any special indentation requirements]
```

Then, separately provide the compliance checklist in plain Markdown (not a code block):

Checklist answers must be as short as possible ("Yes", "No", or 3-5 words). Do not explain or elaborate.

1. Opening line: "Physics PhD..."?
2. 2-3 phrases, max 60 words?
3. Keywords integrated naturally?
4. No bullet points?
5. No company names/titles?
6. No redundancy with later sections?
7. Human, professional, not robotic?

For each, answer in one line only. Avoid yapping or extra commentary.

**IMPORTANT: Provide only the implementation plan and compliance checklist. Do not add any additional commentary or explanations.**"""

# Bullet point planning step
# STAR METHOD from Columbia: https://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/resources/resumes-impact-creating-strong-bullet-points
EditorPrompt4 = """Now you will create a detailed execution plan for optimizing the bullet points in the experience, projects, and other sections. Your primary goal is to PRESERVE the specificity and technical accuracy of existing bullet points while making only the most compelling and natural keyword optimizations.

**CRITICAL MODIFICATION THRESHOLDS:**
You may ONLY suggest modifying an existing bullet point if ALL of these conditions are met:
1. The keyword from the job description has Priority ≥7 AND Confidence ≥7 from our previous analysis
2. The modification preserves or enhances the technical specificity of the original bullet
3. The change sounds completely natural and human-written
4. The keyword is central to the job requirements, not just a "nice to have"
5. The modification doesn't lose any important technical details from the original

**PRESERVATION RULES:**
1. **Never Sacrifice Specificity**: 
   - Do NOT replace specific technical terms with more generic ones
   - Example: Never change 'Transformer architecture' to 'deep learning' even if the job asks for 'deep learning'
   - The specific term implicitly proves the generic skill. If the term is highly relevant and missing from the profile, then consider adding it.

2. **Maintain Technical Accuracy**:
   - Every technical claim must remain 100% accurate
   - If unsure about a technical equivalence, DO NOT suggest the change
   - Preserve all metrics, numbers, and specific achievements

3. **Natural Language Priority**:
   - Changes must sound like they were written by a human expert
   - Avoid awkward keyword insertions
   - Preserve the original voice and style

**BULLET POINT ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST:**
Before suggesting ANY change to a bullet point, verify:
1. Is this change absolutely necessary? (The answer should usually be "no")
2. Does it preserve ALL technical details?
3. Does it sound completely natural?
4. Is it more valuable than the original wording?
5. Does it maintain or enhance specificity?

If ANY answer is "no", DO NOT suggest the change.

**Current Resume Draft:**
```yaml
{resume_draft}
```

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
First, provide the implementation plan in a YAML code block:

```yaml
BULLET_POINTS_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN:
  SECTION_ANALYSIS:
    EXPERIENCE:
      STRENGTHS: [List strengths]
      POTENTIAL_CHANGES:
        BULLET_1:
          ORIGINAL: [Original text]
          PROPOSED: [Proposed change]

            TECHNICAL_ACCURACY: [Yes/No with explanation]
          RECOMMENDATION: [Proceed or Skip with explanation]
```

Then, separately provide the accountability checklist in its own Markdown section:

1. Is this change absolutely necessary? (The answer should usually be "no")
   - [Your explanation]
2. Does it preserve ALL technical details?
   - [Your explanation]
3. Does it sound completely natural?
   - [Your explanation]
4. Is it more valuable than the original wording?
   - [Your explanation]
5. Does it maintain or enhance specificity?

Remember: The default action should be to preserve existing bullet points. Only suggest changes that are absolutely compelling and necessary."""




# Resume optimizer simply implements changes; doesn't have to 'think' much
OptimizerPrompt = """You are an expert resume editor. Your task is to revise the provided resume YAML to incorporate the detailed optimization plans from the Editor.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Follow the Plans Exactly**: You must implement the changes specified in both plans. Do not add, remove, or modify anything not explicitly mentioned in the plans' `IMPLEMENTATION` or `PROPOSED` fields.
2.  **Parse YAML Plans**: Both plans are in YAML format. Look for fields marked with `CHANGE: true` to identify what needs to be modified.
3.  **Preserve Existing Content**: Do not alter any part of the resume that is not targeted by a change in the plans.
4.  **Maintain YAML Structure**: The output must be valid YAML.
5.  **Adhere to Formatting Rules**: Ensure all LaTeX and string formatting rules are applied correctly in the final YAML. This includes escaping special characters (`\\%`, `\\_`, `\\$`, etc.) and using single quotes for all strings. This only applies to content in single-quotes (section keys like leadership_and_awards should not be escaped.)
6.  **Natural Language**: Make the language flow naturally - avoid robotic keyword stuffing while implementing the requested changes.

**Profile Optimization Plan:**
```yaml
{profile_plan}
```

**Bullet Points Optimization Plan:**
```yaml
{bullet_points_plan}
```

**Original Resume YAML:**
```yaml
{resume_yaml}

**IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS:**
1. For the Profile Plan: Look for `IMPLEMENTATION` steps and apply them to the profile section
2. For the Bullet Points Plan: Look for entries with `CHANGE: true` and replace `ORIGINAL` text with `PROPOSED` text
3. Preserve all other content exactly as provided
4. Ensure the final output maintains natural, human-readable language

# Updated validation prompts for separate validator agent
ValidationPrompt = """You are an independent resume validation expert. Your job is to analyze ONLY THE EDITED SECTIONS of a resume against the candidate's actual experiences and identify any potential dishonesty or exaggeration.

**JOB DESCRIPTION:**
---
{job_description}
---

**CANDIDATE'S ACTUAL EXPERIENCES:**
---
{experiences}
---

**INITIAL RESUME (BASELINE TRUTH):**
This is the candidate's original resume that they wrote themselves. All claims in this resume should be considered truthful and accurate.
---
{initial_resume}
---

**EDITED RESUME SECTIONS TO VALIDATE:**
Note: You are only seeing the sections that were modified, not the full resume.
---
{edited_resume}
---

**VALIDATION TASK:**
1. **Line-by-line Analysis**: Go through each claim in the edited sections and cross-reference it against the candidate's actual experiences
2. **Job Relevance Check**: Verify that skills listed are relevant to the target job description and not just "skill padding"
3. **Identify Issues**: Flag any statements that are:
   - Exaggerated beyond what the experiences support
   - Claim skills/knowledge not evidenced in the experiences
   - Use metrics or achievements that seem inflated
   - Include false or fabricated information
   - Misrepresent the scope or impact of work
   - **Include skills not mentioned in the job description (skill padding)**
   - **Overstate proficiency level based on limited experience**

**IMPORTANT SKILLS SECTION GUIDANCE:**
- **Simple skill listings (e.g., "Python", "C++", "SQL") are ACCEPTABLE** even if the candidate has only foundational knowledge, because the skills list format doesn't allow for elaboration on proficiency levels
- **Skills should be job-relevant** - flag skills that don't appear in the job description unless they're clearly core to the role
- **Hiring managers can infer depth from experiences** or ask during interviews
- **Only flag skills claims with explicit proficiency levels** that are unsupported (e.g., "Expert C++", "Advanced Machine Learning", "Senior-level Python")
- **Focus on obvious fabrications** - skills the candidate has never used or been exposed to
- **Flag "skill padding"** - adding skills that aren't job-relevant just to fill space

4. **Severity Assessment**: For each issue, determine if it's:
   - **Minor**: Slight exaggeration or optimistic phrasing, non-job-relevant skills
   - **Moderate**: Clear exaggeration that stretches credibility  
   - **Major**: Significant false claims or fabricated information

5. **Generate Report**: Provide:
   - List of specific issues found
   - Explanation of why each claim is problematic
   - Reference to what the actual experiences support
   - Assessment of job relevance for skills listed
   - Overall assessment of honesty

6. **Dishonesty Score**: Assign a score from 0-100:
   - **0-20**: Honest with minor embellishments
   - **21-40**: Some concerning exaggerations or irrelevant skills
   - **41-60**: Multiple significant exaggerations
   - **61-80**: Substantial dishonesty across sections
   - **81-100**: Heavily fabricated or false information

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
First, provide the validation results in a YAML code block:

```yaml
VALIDATION_RESULTS:
  DISHONESTY_SCORE: [0-100]

# Bold formatting prompt for strategic keyword highlighting
BoldFormattingPrompt = """You are a LaTeX formatting expert specializing in strategic keyword highlighting for resumes. Your goal is to apply `\\textbf{{}}` formatting to key terms that will help the resume stand out to hiring managers while maintaining visual balance and professional appearance.

**STRATEGIC FORMATTING PRINCIPLES:**

1. **Visual Balance**: Distribute bold formatting evenly across the entire resume - avoid clustering too many bold terms in one section
2. **Keyword Density Limits**: 
   - Profile section: Maximum 3 bold terms
   - Each bullet point: Maximum 1-2 bold terms
   - Skills section: Maximum 4-5 bold terms total
3. **Uniqueness Rule**: Each keyword should only be bolded ONCE in the entire resume unless terms are sufficiently spaced (different sections + meaningful context)
4. **Impact Prioritization**: Bold the most impactful, job-relevant keywords that best summarize each bullet point or section

**TARGET KEYWORDS TO CONSIDER:**
{target_keywords}

**FORMATTING GUIDELINES:**

1. **Preserve Existing Formatting**: Keep all current `\\textbf{{}}` formatting that is already well-placed
2. **LaTeX Syntax**: Use `\\textbf{{keyword}}` format exactly
3. **Natural Boundaries**: Only bold complete words or meaningful phrases, not partial words
4. **Context Relevance**: Choose keywords that best represent the core achievement or skill in that specific context
5. **Professional Appearance**: The final result should look polished, not overwhelming or keyword-stuffed

**SELECTION STRATEGY:**
- **Profile**: Choose 2-3 most important skills/expertise areas that align with job requirements
- **Experience/Projects**: Bold 1-2 terms per bullet that capture the main technical skill or achievement
- **Skills**: Bold 4-5 most job-relevant technical skills, prioritizing those not already bolded elsewhere
- **Education**: Bold 1-2 key technical terms or methodologies if highly relevant

**CURRENT RESUME:**
```yaml
{resume_yaml}
```

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Analyze the current resume and identify existing bold formatting
2. Review the target keywords and identify the most impactful ones for this specific resume
3. Apply strategic bold formatting following the principles above
4. Ensure visual balance across all sections
5. Avoid over-formatting - when in doubt, don't bold

**OUTPUT:**
Provide the complete resume YAML with strategic bold formatting applied. Use single quotes for all strings and proper LaTeX escaping. Output only the YAML code block with no additional commentary."""
